Recommended 3-Phase Approach
Phase 1: Immediate Fix (Quick Win - Today)
Add a Lot Inventory Display to your dashboard showing:

Current inventory quantity for each lot
Which lot is "active" (should be used first)
Visual indicator when a lot is depleted
New Page: "Lot Inventory Monitor"

Table view: SKU | Lot | Qty On Hand | Status | Priority
Color coding: Green (active), Yellow (low stock), Red (depleted)
Manual controls to set priority (which lot to use first)
Phase 2: Semi-Automation (This Week)
Add Bulk Order Lot Assignment tool:

Button: "Update Pending Orders to Use New Lot"
Select SKU, old lot, new lot
Updates all pending orders in one click
Prevents manual one-by-one updates
Phase 3: Full Automation (Next Week)
Implement Smart Lot Allocation System:

Track inventory quantities by lot (not just SKU)
Automatically assign lots to orders based on:
Priority (manual override for "use this lot first")
FIFO (oldest lot first by default)
Availability (auto-switch when lot runs out)
Reserve inventory when orders created
Real-time depletion tracking
🏗️ Technical Implementation
New Database Table: lot_inventory

- sku (e.g., "17612")
- lot (e.g., "250237")
- quantity_on_hand (e.g., 5000)
- quantity_reserved (orders not shipped yet)
- priority (1, 2, 3... for sort order)
- received_date (for FIFO)
- status (active/depleted/quarantine)
New Database Table: order_item_lot_assignments

- order_number
- sku
- lot_assigned
- quantity
- assigned_at
Modified Workflow:

When XML imports orders → Check lot_inventory for available lots
Allocate lot automatically (priority-based or FIFO)
Reserve quantity in lot_inventory
When shipped → Deduct from lot_inventory
When lot depleted → Auto-switch to next priority lot
⚡ Quick Start: What I Recommend Building First
Option A: Just Display (Fastest - 30 min)

New page showing current lot inventory levels
Manual controls to update lot assignments
Bulk update tool for switching lots
Option B: Semi-Automated (Medium - 2-3 hours)

Option A + automatic lot selection on import
Still requires manual lot inventory updates
Option C: Fully Automated (Full - 1 day)

Complete system with reservation tracking
Auto-depletion, auto-switching, full audit trail
🤔 Questions for You:
Which phase do you want to start with? (Quick display first, or jump to automation?)

How do you currently know lot quantities? (Manual count? Separate system? Need to manually enter?)

Lot selection preference:

Use oldest lot first (FIFO)?
Manual priority (you set which lot to use)?
Hybrid (FIFO with override capability)?
For today's immediate problem: Should I build a quick tool to bulk-update all pending orders from old lot → new lot for SKU 17612?
